                Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy
                text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The
                passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th
                century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's
                De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen
                book. It usually begins with:“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
                consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
                ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.” The purpose of lorem ipsum
                is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence,
                paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.
                A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with
                meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus
                is meant to be on design, not content.

                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney
                College, is credited with discovering the source behind
                the ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem
                ipsum, his interest was piqued by consectetur—a genuine,
                albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a Latin dictionary
                led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
                Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-
                century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher Cicero.       In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero's work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:
